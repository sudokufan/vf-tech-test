## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### To Do

With more time, I would like to:

- create a variables file for commonly-used sizes, brand colours, typography styling etc
- add Redux or a resource context/provider to save the duplicate resource API calls across different views
